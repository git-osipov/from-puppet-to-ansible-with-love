### Current requirements.yml
```yaml
---
# Ansible Galaxy requirements
collections:
  - name: ansible.posix
    version: ">=2.0.0"

roles: []
```

## Ruby Dependencies

### Current Gemfile Structure
The Gemfile remains well-organized with proper grouping:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'puppet', '~> 8.10'
gem 'facter', '~> 4.10'

group :test do
  gem 'rspec-puppet', '~> 5.0'
  gem 'puppetlabs_spec_helper', '~> 8.0'
  gem 'puppet-lint', '~> 4.2'
  gem 'puppet-syntax', '~> 4.0'
  gem 'metadata-json-lint', '~> 4.0'
end

group :development do
  gem 'r10k', '~> 4.1'
end
```

**Note**: Test and development gems are kept as they provide valuable functionality for code quality and testing.

## Validation Results

### Puppet Validation
- ✅ All manifests pass syntax validation
- ✅ All required modules are available and functional

### Ansible Validation
- ✅ All playbooks pass syntax validation
- ✅ All playbooks pass ansible-lint validation (6 minor schema warnings remain)
- ✅ All roles execute successfully in test runs

### Test Results
- ✅ Comprehensive test playbook: 21 tasks ok, 2 changed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 4 ignored
- ✅ All core functionality verified working

## Benefits of Updates

1. **Security**: Latest versions include security patches and bug fixes
2. **Performance**: Newer versions often include performance improvements
3. **Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with modern systems
4. **Maintenance**: Reduced dependency footprint makes maintenance easier
5. **Features**: Access to latest features and improvements

## Breaking Changes Handled

### Ansible 2.0.0 Collections
- No breaking changes encountered in ansible.posix 2.0.0
- All existing FQCN usage patterns continue to work

### Puppet ACL Module 5.0.3
- No breaking changes encountered
- All existing `posix_acl` resource usage continues to work

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Consider updating dependencies quarterly
2. **Testing**: Always run comprehensive tests after dependency updates
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for new versions of critical dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Keep dependency versions documented in requirements files

## Files Modified

- `Puppetfile` - Updated ACL module version, removed unused modules
- `ansible/requirements.yml` - Updated ansible.posix version, removed community.general
- `check_unused_deps.py` - Created utility script for dependency analysis

## Conclusion

All dependencies have been successfully updated to their latest stable versions. The codebase continues to function correctly with improved security, performance, and maintainability. Unused dependencies have been pruned to reduce the project's footprint.
